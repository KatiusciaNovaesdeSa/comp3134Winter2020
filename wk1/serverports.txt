A port number is a way to identify a specific process to which an Internet or other network message is to be forwarded when it arrives at a server.

Port numbers range from 0 to 65535, but only port numbers 0 to 1023 are reserved for privileged services and designated as well-known ports. 
Ports are numbered for consistency and programming. The most commonly used and best known ports are those numbered 0 to 1023 dedicated for Internet use, but they can extend far higher for specialized purposes. Each port set or range is assigned specialized jobs or functions, and that's generally all they do. Usually, all identical system services or functions use the same port numbers on the receiving servers..
